# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# **My React Projects Journey ðŸš€**

Welcome to my repository showcasing various **React projects**! ðŸŒŸ These projects represent my journey in learning and building with React. From simple applications to more complex ones, each project highlights different concepts and techniques that I've explored while mastering React.

---

## ðŸš€ **Technologies Used**

- **React**: Core frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Modern JavaScript for writing clean and efficient code.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Styling the apps with modern CSS techniques.
- **API Integration**: Communicating with third-party services and fetching data dynamically.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why These Projects?**

These projects reflect my growing understanding of **React** and web development. They are stepping stones in my journey to master front-end technologies, and each one builds on the previous, incorporating new skills such as:

- **React Hooks** (like `useState`, `useEffect`)
- **React Router** for navigation
- **State management** and component reusability
- **Handling API requests**

---

## ðŸ¤” **What's Next?**

Iâ€™m just getting started! In the future, I plan to:

1. **Build more advanced projects** using **Redux** for state management.
2. **Implement authentication systems** (login, sign-up, etc.).
3. **Create responsive UIs** with mobile-first design principles.
4. **Integrate more external APIs** and work on performance optimizations.
