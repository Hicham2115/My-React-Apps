# My React Journey

## Introduction

Hi there! üëã I'm Hicham, a passionate web developer from Morocco. Over the past few months, I've been diving deep into **React** to enhance my skills and build powerful, dynamic web applications. This README will walk you through my journey with React, the projects I've worked on, and what I‚Äôve learned along the way.

---

## üéØ **Learning Objectives**
When I started learning React, my main goals were:
- To gain a solid understanding of **React components, hooks, and state management**.
- To build dynamic, responsive web applications.
- To explore best practices like **component reusability** and **performance optimization**.

---

## üìö **Technologies Used**
Throughout my journey, I have worked with the following technologies:
- **React** (with Hooks and Class Components)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **CSS Frameworks** (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)
- **State Management** (Context API, Redux)
- **APIs** (Fetching data with Axios)
- **Version Control** (Git & GitHub)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Projects Built with React**

### 1. **My React Apps Portfolio**
- **Description**: A collection of different React applications that showcase various projects and demos I've built. This project is a portfolio of my work and allows me to experiment with different features and layouts.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic routing with React Router.
  - Interactive UI components.
  - State management with **useState** and **useContext**.
  - Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for flexibility and responsiveness.
- **What I Learned**: 
  - How to organize a project with multiple components.
  - The importance of clean, reusable code.

### 2. **Task Manager**
- **Description**: A task manager web app to help users organize and manage their tasks. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Key Features**:
  - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
  - Local storage to persist tasks between page reloads.
  - Responsive design with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
- **What I Learned**:
  - Managing state locally and globally.
  - Using **localStorage** to persist data in React.

### 3. **Weather App**
- **Description**: A weather app that fetches real-time data from a weather API and displays weather details based on the user's location or search.
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetching data from an external API.
  - Error handling for invalid city names or API failures.
  - Search functionality for different cities.
- **What I Learned**:
  - Working with asynchronous JavaScript using **Axios**.
  - Handling API responses and displaying dynamic data.

## üîß **Tools & Libraries**
- **React Router**: For handling page navigation in single-page applications.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- **Redux**: For global state management in more complex apps.
- **React Bootstrap**: For faster UI component design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first custom designs.

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps**
As I continue my React journey, my goals include:
- Deepening my understanding of **React Hooks** (useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
- Exploring **TypeScript** for better type safety in React apps.
- Learning about **server-side rendering (SSR)** with **Next.js**.
- Contributing to open-source projects to collaborate and gain more experience.
